# High-Dimensional-Noisy-Matrix-Decomposition-in-a-Bayesian-Multi-task-Regression-Model
- R and Stan codes for the ongoing project: "High-Dimensional Noisy Matrix Decomposition in a Bayesian Multi-task Regression Model".
- Here, we are studying the behavior of a similar (as in https://github.com/souravmukherjee2906/Bayesian-Robust-Principal-Component-Analysis/blob/main/README.md) Bayesian model for high-dimensional noisy matrix decomposition problems in the multi-task regression settings and working to establish posterior consistency and a Markov chain CLT.
- This project is currently ongoing under the supervision of Dr. Kshitij Khare and Dr. George Michailidis in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida.
- Sourav Mukherjee is the sole contributor in writing the codes and doing the simulations in this research project.
